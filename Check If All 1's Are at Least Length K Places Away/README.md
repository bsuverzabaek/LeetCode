# Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away
- Given an binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if all 1's are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `false`.

## Analysis
- This solution made more sense than my original one
- My original one involved making a `temp` array to store the indexes of all 1's
