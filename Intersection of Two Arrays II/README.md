# Intersection of Two Arrays II
- Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

## Analysis
- I was a bit confused with the directions
- I did not know about the Counter function, which stores objects as keys and counts as values in a dictionary
