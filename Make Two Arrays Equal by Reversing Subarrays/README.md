# Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Subarrays
- You are given two integer arrays of equal length `target` and `arr`. In one step, you can select any non-empty subarray of `arr` and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.
- Return `true` if you can make `arr` equal to `target` or `false` otherwise.

## Analysis
- Using `sorted()` would have made this a one-liner
