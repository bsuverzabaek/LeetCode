# Sort Array By Parity
- Given an integer array `nums`, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.
- Return any array that satisfies this condition.

## Analysis
- What's interesting is that the first solution had a faster runtime even though I iterate through the list twice
