# Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time
- Given two integer arrays `startTime` and `endTime` and given an integer `queryTime`.
- The i<sup>th</sup> student started doing their homework at the time `startTime[i]` and finished it at time `endTime[i]`.
- Return the number of students doing their homework at time `queryTime`. More formally, return the number of students where `queryTime` lays in the interval `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]` inclusive.

## Analysis
- This was one of the easier ones
