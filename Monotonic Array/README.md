# Monotonic Array
- An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.
- An array `nums` is monotone increasing if for all `i <= j`, `nums[i] <= nums[j]`. An array `nums` is monotone decreasing if for all `i <= j`, `nums[i] >= nums[j]`.
- Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if the given array is monotonic, or `false` otherwise.

## Analysis
- My original method invloved making a case-by-case scenario, but that would of took too long
