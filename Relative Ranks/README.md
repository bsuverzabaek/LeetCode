# Relative Ranks
- You are given an integer array `score` of size `n`, where `score[i]` is the score of the i<sup>th</sup> athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.
- The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the 1<sup>st</sup> place athlete has the highest score, the 2<sup>nd</sup> place athlete has the 2<sup>nd</sup> highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:
- The 1<sup>st</sup> place athlete's rank is `"Gold Medal"`.
- The 2<sup>nd</sup> place athlete's rank is `"Silver Medal"`.
- The 3<sup>rd</sup> place athlete's rank is `"Bronze Medal"`.
- For the 4<sup>th</sup> place to the n<sup>th</sup> place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the x<sup>th</sup> place athlete's rank is `"x"`).
- Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the rank of the i<sup>th</sup> athlete.
