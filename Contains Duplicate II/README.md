# Contains Duplicate II
- Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if there are two **distinct indices** `i` and `j` in the array such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.

## Analysis
- I based the code off of another solution from another problem
- I was able to reduce the runtime of my earlier submission by getting rid of redundancies
- I saw a solution that utilized `set` in a clever way; I should make more use of that
