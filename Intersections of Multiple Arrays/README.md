# Intersections of Multiple Arrays
- Given a 2D integer array `nums` where `nums[i]` is a non-empty array of distinct positive integers, return the list of integers that are present in each array of `nums` sorted in ascending order.

## Analysis
- I implemented a brute-force approach to this problem even though there are other ways of doing this
