# Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies
- There are `n` kids with candies. You are given an integer array `candies`, where each `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the i<sup>th</sup> kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.
- Return a boolean array `result` of length `n`, where `result[i]` is `true` if, after giving the i<sup>th</sup> kid all the `extraCandies`, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or `false` otherwise.
- Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

## Analysis
- Instead of an `if-else` statement, I can just use the condition alone
