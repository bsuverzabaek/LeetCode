# Array Partition
- Given an integer array `nums` of `2n` integers, group these integers into `n` pairs `(a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn)` such that the sum of `min(ai, bi)` for all `i` is maximized. Return the maximized sum.

## Analysis
- I didn't notice that only every other element in the sorted array was necessary
