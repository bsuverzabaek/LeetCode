# Shuffle String
- You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the same length. The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at the i<sup>th</sup> position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string.
- Return the shuffled string.

## Analysis
- This shows a good way of making one-liners for `dicts`
