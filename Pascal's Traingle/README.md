# Pascal's Triangle
- Given an integer `numRows`, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

## Analysis
- I originally wanted to solve this using powers of 11 and listifying the result, but after `n=6`, the coefficients needed to be split up, which was too difficult to do.
- Although this is the brute force method, it still was accepted
