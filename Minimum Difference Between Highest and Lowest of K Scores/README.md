# Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores
- You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the score of the i<sup>th</sup> student. You are also given an integer `k`.
- Pick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the `k` scores is minimized.
- Return the minimum possible difference.

## Analysis
- I needed to go through each possibility instead of just going with the highest and second-highest elements
