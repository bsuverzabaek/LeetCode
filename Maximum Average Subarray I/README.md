# Maximum Average Subarray I
- You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements, and an integer `k`.
- Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to `k` that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10<sup>-5</sup> will be accepted.

## Analysis
- This uses the sliding window concept
- I thought we could adjust `nums` with `sort`, but it turns out we can't.
- This method makes more sense; I will think about this more
