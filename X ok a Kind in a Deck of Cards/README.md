# X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards
- You are given an integer array `deck` where `deck[i]` represents the number written on the i<sup>th</sup> card.
- Partition the cards into one or more groups such that:
  - Each group has exactly `x` cards where `x > 1`, and
  - All the cards in one group have the same integer written on them.
- Return `true` if such partition is possible, or `false` otherwise.

## Analysis
- I didn't know you could use the `gcd` function for lists using `*`. That would have been useful earlier
