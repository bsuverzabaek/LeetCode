# Two Out of Three
- Given three integer arrays `nums1`, `nums2`, and `nums3`, return a distinct array containing all the values that are present in at least two out of the three arrays. You may return the values in any order.

## Analysis
- This is an alternative to successively going through 3 lists that does not need 3 `for` loops
