# Maximum Number of Pairs in Array
- You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. In one operation, you may do the following:
  - Choose two integers in `nums` that are equal.
  - Remove both integers from `nums`, forming a pair.
- The operation is done on `nums` as many times as possible.
- Return a 0-indexed integer array `answer` of size `2` where `answer[0]` is the number of pairs that are formed and `answer[1]` is the number of leftover integers in `nums` after doing the operation as many times as possible.

## Analysis
- This did not require much thought
