# Check If It Is a Straight Line
- You are given an array `coordinates`, `coordinates[i] = [x, y]`, where `[x, y]` represents the coordinate of a point. Check if these points make a straight line in the XY plane.

## Analysis
- Finding the slope is the key
- Using the cross product prevents a possible division by 0
