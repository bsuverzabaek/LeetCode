# Largest Perimeter Triangle
- Given an integer array `nums`, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return `0`.

## Analysis
- I thought I had to confirm all parts of the perimeter theorem, but it turns out that wasn't necessary
