# Count Equal and Divisible Pairs in an Array
- Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`, return the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < n`, such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `(i * j)` is divisible by `k`.

## Analysis
- This shows that the values of `dict` can be lists
- This also shows one way to go through every possible pair without using a nested `for` loop
